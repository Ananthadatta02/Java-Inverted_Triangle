# Java-Inverted_Triangle
This Java program generates an inverted triangle number pattern based on user input. It first prompts the user to enter the size (n) of the pattern. Using nested loops, it prints leading spaces to create the right alignment. Then, it prints an increasing sequence of numbers followed by a decreasing sequence to form the symmetric pattern.
